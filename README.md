### WELCOME ðŸ‘‹

I'm James and it's nice to virtually meet you.

I live in California, USA and enjoy the simple things in life. I have been disabled since about 2021 due to Agoraphobia and other ailments that came out of nowhere. My passions are computers, technology, coding, vehicles, and really anything I can do nowadays. My child is my world, and my family is everything to me. I treat everyone how I expect to be treated, and I believe in understanding/listening before assumptions.

My Moto:
Integrity, Compassion, Freedom, & the Pursuit of Happiness

### MY CODING JOURNEY

Starting in 2012, I began my journey with the most basic HTML/PHP website using my own spaghetti code. This basic site had random things like auto playing music, random buttons that would take you around to other random pages just for fun, and even random images throughout. It was nothing usable nor impressive, but I just loved the capabilities so far. Most of the random pages also included things like poetry, pages for the animals we had in the house, and pages to showcase the important people in my life. Never did I think for a minute that I could do much more than that... I really thought things like myspace and facebook were some sophisticated thing that I could never learn.

Fast forward to about 2015, I realized my mom had a challenge keeping track of her litters, clients, puppies, and even deposits. This is what ultimately opened me to the world of serious coding. It was basic at first, still spaghetti code as well, but I was determined and spent countless hours making it work for her. Eventually in about 2020, I realized that this software is severely limited to just my mom. There was no way for others to use it, and everything was very hard coded and not dynamic. This opened my mind to researching frameworks. I started trying to pay people to revamp my projects into frameworks, but nobody could figure out what my coding did even if I spent hours explaning it. So, I caved in, buckled down, and went on a journey to learn the "right way". MVC, proper formatting, comments/notes, and more. I started with things like Bootstrap, then Laravel, then Livewire, and just kept adding from there. I still mostly specialize in PHP and backend based coding, but I'm always up to using and/or learning others!

As of 2023, I now have approximately 16 personal Laravel projects for friends, familiy, and more. Unfortunately these have to remain private, but you can see my contribution history on my profile :) I'm also venturing into other projects, including private and public (open source or not) when they come my way.

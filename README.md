### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I am James and it's nice to virtually meet you.

I live in California, USA and enjoy the simple things in life. I have been disabled since about 2021 due to Agoraphobia and other ailments that came out of nowhere. My passions are computers, technology, coding, vehicles, and really anything I can do nowadays. My child is my world, and my family is everything to me. I treat everyone how I expect to be treated, and I believe in understanding/listening before assumptions.

My Moto:
Integrity, Compassion, Freedom, & the Pursuit of Happiness

I have been coding since about 2012. Starting with PHP and my own spaghetti code and a very basic website with things like auto playing music, random buttons to take you to another page and then another and another just for fun, and even random images throughout - because I thought it was so cool to play with. Never did I think for a minute did I imagine I could do much more than that...

Eventually I realized that spaghetti code can only get you so far, and makes things VERY complicated/confusing, especially for projects. I tried paying people to revamp my projects into frameworks, but nobody could figure out what my coding did. So, I caved in, buckled down, and went on a journey to learn the "right way". MVC, proper formatting, comments/notes, and more. I started with things like Bootstrap, then Laravel, then Livewire, and just kept adding from there. I still mostly specialize in PHP based coding, but I'm always up to other methods!
